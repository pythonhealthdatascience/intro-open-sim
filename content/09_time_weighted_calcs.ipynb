    "# Collecting time weighted results\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is a more advanced topic related to results collection in DES.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously we calculated utilisation of servers by tracking the total usage time of resources (e.g. Nurses).  At the end of a run of the model this total was divided by the total scheduled time for that resource (i.e. no. resources multipled by the results collection period).  A downside to this approach is that when we include a warm-up period in the model there is a minor adjustment we need to make to results to account for servers already being in use. If we don't make this adjustment we can end up with utilisations higher than 100% we carry forward some resource usage time from the warm-up period into the results collection period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of modifying the model logic we could instead calculate a **time weighted average**.  We will do that by subclassing the `simpy.Resource` class to create a `MonitoredResource`.  Each time a `MonitoredResource` is requested or released we will update some statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is often presented in a complex way. But in general you can think of another approach to tracking.  In the modified code below we will track:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The time of the last request or release event for the resource.\n",
    "2. The number of servers in use **before** the event executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data allows us to calculate a running total of the time the total time resources have been in use up to that time point. When we update the total we:\n",
    "\n",
    "* multiply the number of servers in use **before** the event by the time elapsed since the last event.\n",
    "* Add this value to the running total.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the run we can compute utilisation by dividing the running total by the total scheduled time."
