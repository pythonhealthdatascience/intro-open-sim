    "A key part of any computer simulation study is **experimentation**.  Here a set of experiments will be conducted in an attempt to understand and find improvements to the system under study.  Experiments essentially vary inputs and process logic.\n",

    "We can do this manually, but as we develop a model the number of input parameters will increase. \n",

    "💡 There are several data structures you might employ to organise parameters.\n",

    "* a python dictionary\n",
    "* a custom parameter class\n",
    "* a dataclass\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these approaches work well and it really is a matter of judgement on what you prefer. One downside of a python `dict` and a custom class is that they are both mutable (although a class can have custom properties where users can only access 'viewable' attributes).  A dataclass can easily be made immutable and requires less code than a custom class, but has the downside that its syntax is a little less pythonic. Here we will build a parameter class called `Experiment`.  \n",
